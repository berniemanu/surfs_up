# Overview
I analyzed the 2010-2018 weather data using Python and SQLAlchemy to query a SQLite file containing weather data for the island of Oahu. I had to determine the expected temperature in June and December.

## Results:
My codes made the decision making process easier with clear temperature statistics for the months of June and December to make the right investment decisions.

## Summary:
There is no significant difference between the weather in June and December. December is slightly colder than June. We can also run more queries to see the precipitation data for June and December and decide how long to keep the surf shack open during the winter/rainy days. We cam also run queries to specifically check the temperature and precipitation during school holidays and christmas break to see how long we can keep the surf shack open.
